# E-mail Draft: Translation Management Coordinator

**Subject:** Questions About Translation Process and Materials Usage - Planning Estonian CoDA Website

---

Dear Translation Management Coordinator,

I am writing to you from Estonia regarding our CoDA group. We have been actively meeting for some time, but have not yet officially registered our meeting on coda.org or created a public website.

**Background:**
There was previously a registered CoDA group in Estonia that is no longer active, so there is currently no up-to-date Estonian language information available publicly. We are now planning to formalize our presence and create an accessible website for the Estonian recovery community.

We have some materials already translated into Estonian for internal use within our group, but these have not been published or made publicly available. As I am a relatively new member, I do not know when, by whom, or under what agreements/permissions these translations were made. Now we want to proceed properly by registering our meeting and obtaining official translation permissions before making any materials public.

We will submit the formal translation permission application after our meeting registration is complete. However, to properly plan our website structure and content, we need clarification on several important questions.

**Questions:**

**1. Translation Scope**
Which materials require translation permission for use on our website after receiving approval? Specifically:
- 12 Steps, 12 Traditions, 12 Promises
- Patterns and Characteristics of Codependence
- Daily Meditations ("In This Moment")
- Pamphlets (Welcome, Am I Codependent, etc.)
- Reference: https://coda.org/wp-content/uploads/CoDA-Endorsed-Literature-List_3.9.2025_Translation-and-PD-List.pdf

Are there any CoDA materials that do NOT require translation permission and can be freely translated and used?

**2. Copyright Notice**
How should copyright be displayed on our website? What is the exact text/format required for translated materials?

**3. Visual Identity**
Who should we contact regarding questions about using CoDA logo, colors, and visual style in our website design?

**4. Translation Process**
- Does each material from the endorsed literature list require a separate translation permission request?
- Or does one initial application cover all materials we wish to translate?

**5. After Translation**
What are the next steps after we complete a translation:
- Do translated materials need to be submitted to CoDA for review/approval?
- Who should we contact and how does the quality control process work?
- After approval, what materials are we allowed to use on our website or print, and are there any restrictions or different permissions for different materials?

**6. Existing Estonian Translations**
Have any translation permissions been previously granted for Estonian language? Are there any approved Estonian translations already available from other sources?

**7. Translation Grant**
Has Estonia ever applied for or received the $1,000 USD translation/publication grant? If not, when and how can we apply for this support?

Additionally, are there specific requirements or guidelines for how the grant funds can be used, what restrictions apply, and what reporting or accountability is required?

These answers will help us plan our website structure effectively and ensure we follow all proper procedures.

Thank you for your guidance and assistance.

In service,
